    <h1>Pondicherry Police History</h1>

    <p>The Corps of Sipayes was reorganised in 1773 with each company under a 'white' commandant, with Indian subedars and Jamedars. And recruitment then was restricted too purely from among caste Indians, In later days, people came to distinguish the two- the Armed and the Indigenous, by the colour of their Keppe (headgear). While the law and order police wore the bright red cap, the Armed units were conspicuous by their blue Kepees.
</p>

      <p>Gradually one can seen an admixture of duties for these members of the police force, combining municipal duties with combative ones. In 1790 the 'Reglement General de Police' was established , with the introduction the Lieutenant de Police as the head of the police force responsible not only for law and order, but also to sit on judgement over disputes that came under the purview of the 'Choultry Court' with jurisdiction extending over Pondicherry and its dependencies. Another distinction was also introduced wherein the 'Inspecteurs Municipaux' were empowered to take cognizance of offences - Indicating a mixture of municipal duties alongside law and order functions. The Pondicherry the Gazetteer also mentions that, the Chief local police officer during the early French period was known as 'grand prevot'. And that he maintained a body of mounted police (Mare chausee) for patrolling the town during the night. The nayinar had to report to the Lieutenant de police the notable events of the town.
</p>

        <p>In 1906 the strength of the police force was reduced, with also the abolition of the 'Cipahis de I'Inde'in the following year. This was sought to be compensated by the creation of Garde Vicile Indigene headed by a Capitaine Commandant. A 1922 notification thereafter designates the head of the police force as Chef du Service de Police et de la Surete-indicating thereby the introduction of the Special Branch and the Security Police. In 1941 the combined police outfits-both, the local police and the Detachment de la Gendarmerie (Compagnie de Cipahis), together came to be now called as Section de la Gendarmerie 'Auxilliaire Indigene,brought under a unified command to be known as Forces Publiques des etablissements Francias dans I'Inde. The combined force then consisted of 629 men. The Chief is now re-designated as the Commandant des Forces Publiques de I'Inde Francaise. In a write up of 1943, Monseieur Le Chef d'escadron Petignot the then Commandant les Forces Publiques de I'Inde Francaise, speaks of the Indigenous police constabulary entrusted with ensuring administrative police and judicial police in most parts of the territory where all the castes and almost all races exist, having to make enquiries in as many as eight different languages - French, English, Tamil, Hindustani, Malayalam, Telugu, Bengali and Oriya indicating the extraordianry situation which this police force was required to function it.  
</p>

          <p>After the merger in 1954 the entire police force was placed under the command of an Inspector General of Police, who then was an officer of the rank of only a Superintendent of Police in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu.    </p>

            <p>The police administration continued to be carried on thought in accordance with the French regulations up to 30th September 1963 . Only with the extension of Indian laws to the territory with effect from 1st October 1963 , the police administration came to be in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Police Act 1861. Then the Anti-Hindi agitation of 1965 that engulfed the entire region and its neighbourhood in Tamil Nadu and brought to the fore the inadequacies of the police force to meet the law and order requirements of this Territory, promoted the government to appoint the Balakrishna Shetty Committee. Pending its report, the functioning was further streamlined through an amendment to the Police Act 1861 in its application to the Territory by the Police (Pondicherry Amendment) Act 1966enacted to suit local conditions, based on the pattern of the neighbouring Tamil Nadu Act.   
</p>

              <p>The new scheme of re-organization as proposed by the team headed by Sri Balakrishna Shetty came into effect on 1st June 1967 and continues as such till date. For purposes of maintenance of law and order the entire Union territory was divided into 2 divisions, into Pondicherry division and Karaikal division. Subsequently, a Pondicherry Police Commission under Shri Pon Paramaguru was established in 1990, whose Report was submitted to the government in 1991 suggesting various charges, augmentation of manpower, and introduction of various policing wings as are prevalent and is required in any efficient modern police force. The recommendations therein, except very minor ones, are yet to see the light of day. The Government of India , in the meantime, have notified on 3 rd March 1998, upgrading the post of the police chief to that of a full-fledged Inspector General.

                <p>Today the bright red cap (in the French Kepi pattern) continues to be retained as the headgear of the constabulary levels-both for the local Police, as also the armed police. This is now the only reminder left, of the French hangover in Pondicherry .
