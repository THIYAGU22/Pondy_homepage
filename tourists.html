          <p>Puducherry previously called Pondicherry and commonly known to as ‘Pondy’ was under the French jurisdiction until 1954 and some people here still speak French and English with French accents. Hotels, restaurants and ‘lifestyle’ shops sell a charming image of the French-subcontinental artistic, magnified by Gallic inventive types whose residence has, in turn, drew Indian artists and designers. Wide highways, seafront stroll, French building, stunning beaches and places of religious significance make Pondicherry a stop worthy of being visited. </p>
